- **Statistical analysis** with summary metrics and distributions
- **Growth projections** with customizable time horizons
- **Real-time calculations** and updates

### 🎨 Color-Coded Results
- 🟢 **Green**: V/C < 0.7 (Good - Adequate capacity)
- 🟡 **Yellow**: V/C 0.7-0.9 (Fair - Approaching capacity)
- 🔴 **Red**: V/C 0.9-1.0 (Poor - At or near capacity)
- 🟣 **Purple**: V/C > 1.0 (Critical - Over capacity)

### 💾 Export Capabilities
- **CSV export** of detailed results
- **Excel export** with multiple worksheets
- **Interactive charts** and visualizations
- **Downloadable reports** with timestamps

## 🔧 Configuration

### County Settings
The application supports multiple Florida counties:
- **Palm Beach County** (default)
- **Broward County**
- **Miami-Dade County**
- **Monroe County**

### Growth Projections
- **Uniform growth rates**: Apply the same growth rate to all segments
- **TAZ-based growth**: Use Transportation Analysis Zone specific rates
- **Customizable time horizons**: 5-30 year projections

### Data Sources
- **FDOT Traffic Online**: Automated data retrieval
- **CSV Upload**: Manual upload of traffic data
- **Manual Entry**: For testing and small datasets

## 📊 Data Requirements

### Required Data
- **Roadway segment data** (shapefile or geodatabase)
- **Traffic volume data** (FDOT or Placer.ai format)
- **Capacity tables** by functional classification
- **TAZ growth factors** (optional, for advanced projections)

### Supported Formats
- **CSV files** with traffic volume data
- **Excel files** (.xlsx, .xls)
- **Shapefiles** (.shp) for geographic data
- **GeoJSON** files for web-based mapping

## 🔌 API Integration

### FDOT Traffic Online
The application is designed to integrate with FDOT's Traffic Online system:
- **Base URL**: `https://tdaappsprod.dot.state.fl.us/fto/`
- **Authentication**: Required for production use
- **Rate limiting**: Configured for API compliance

### Placer.ai Integration
Support for Placer.ai traffic data:
- **CSV format** with standardized column names
- **Automatic validation** of data quality
- **Processing pipeline** for data standardization

## 🛠️ Development

### Adding New Counties
1. Update `config.py` with county coordinates and settings
2. Add county-specific growth rates
3. Configure FDOT district mapping

### Customizing Capacity Tables
1. Modify `CAPACITY_TABLE` in `config.py`
2. Add new functional classifications as needed
3. Update capacity values based on local standards

### Extending Analysis
1. Add new calculation methods in `utils.py`
2. Create additional visualization components
3. Implement new export formats

## 📈 Methodology

### V/C Ratio Calculation
```
V/C Ratio = Current Traffic Volume / Roadway Capacity
```

### Growth Projections
```
Future Volume = Current Volume × (1 + Growth Rate)^Years
```

### Status Classification
- **Good**: V/C < 0.7 (adequate capacity)
- **Fair**: 0.7 ≤ V/C < 0.9 (approaching capacity)
- **Poor**: 0.9 ≤ V/C ≤ 1.0 (at or near capacity)
- **Critical**: V/C > 1.0 (over capacity)
